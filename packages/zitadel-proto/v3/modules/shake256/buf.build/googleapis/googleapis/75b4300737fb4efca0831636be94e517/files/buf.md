**This is a third-party repository managed by Buf.**

This module contains the core types that almost all developers use from the [googleapis](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis) repository, specifically:

- The core files from the `google.api` package, used by many for the HTTP annotations including grpc-gateway.
- The packages `google.api.expr.v1alpha1`, `google.api.expr.v1beta1`, used within Envoy.
- The `google.bytestream` package.
- The `google.longrunning` package.
- The `google.geo.type` package.
- The `google.rpc` package, used by grpc.
- The `google.type` package, containing many common types.

The [source repository](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis) contains over 3800 files, mostly relating
to Google's core APIs. However, the ~30 files above are the only files used by 99.999% of developers, and these files
are the most common dependency in the Protobuf ecosystem. This hosted module only includes these specific
files, as including all the files causes hundreds of megabytes of unused generated code for the vast
majority of developers. To use Google's core APIs, create your own module that has a `dep` on `buf.build/googleapis/googleapis` with the specific packages you want to use.

Note that this slimming down was a recent breaking change - likely the only breaking change we will make before promoting BSR to v1. We taking breaking changes very seriously once launching into v1, and we apologize for any disruption as we wrap up the beta. See [the FAQ](https://docs.buf.build/faq#googleapis-failure) for more details.

Updates to the [source repository](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis) are automatically
synced on a periodic basis, and each BSR commit is tagged with corresponding Git commits.

To depend on a specific Git commit, you can use it as your reference in your dependencies:

```
deps:
  - buf.build/googleapis/googleapis:<GIT_COMMIT_TAG>
```
